					Like all the world's great capitals, Paris lives at a fast pace, by day and
					night. It is divided into 20 districts that spiral out like a snail shell from
					the first, centered round the Louvre. Enjoy a stroll through Paris while on
					vacation and soak up the "art de vivre", it will feel as if you are walking
					through an open-air museum. Admire the city's regal buildings, gardens,
					fountains and places which have witnessed so monumental events & so
					fascinating history.

					Paris is a place of iconic architecture, with its famous cloud-piercing
					Eiffel tower, Arc de Triomphe at the end of the most famous avenue of
					the world, les Champs-Elysees. Notre-Dame and its gargoyles, old
					bridges and Art Nouveau cafes are famously part of the City. Always
					evolving, the City now proudly shows the contemporary Centre
					Pompidou and the Musee du Quai Branly and its vegetal wall.

					picnic in the city's parks and gardens.
