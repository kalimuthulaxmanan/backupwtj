					French people are known for good fashion sense and good food. They
					are courteous people, but also frank and usually to the point. French is
					the official language of France, and it is important for you to learn a bit of
					French. Indeed, your trip will be more enjoyable if you are able to relate
					to French people. Also, it will be easier to understand the culture once
					you learn the language.

					As for French manners, the handshake is commonly used in France
					when people meet another for the first time, in both social and business
					settings. Close friends greet each other by kissing each other on the
					cheek (Ia bise). People typically greet one another with bonjour (good
					morning), bonsoir (good afternoon) and au revoir (goodbye). Party
					guests are expected to bring a gift, such as flowers or a bottle of wine.
