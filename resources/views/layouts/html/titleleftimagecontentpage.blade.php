					Moët et Chandon began as Moët et Cie (Moët & Co.), established by
					Épernay wine trader Claude Moët in 1743, and began shipping his wine
					from Champagne to Paris. The reign of King Louis XV coincided with
					increased demand for sparkling wine. Soon after its foundation, and after
					son Claude-Louis joined Moët et Cie, the winery's clientele included
					nobles and aristocrats. Following the introduction of the concept of a
					vintage champagne in 1840, Moët marketed its first vintage in 1842.
					Their best-selling brand, Brut Imperial was introduced in the 1860s. Their
					best known label, Dom Perignon, is named for the Benedictine monk
					remembered in legend as the "Father of Champagne". Moët & Chandon
					merged with Hennessy Cognac in 1971 and with Louis Vuitton in 1987 to
					become LVMH (Louis-Vuitton-Moët-Hennessy), the largest luxury group
					in the world, netting over 16 billion euros in fiscal 2004. Moët & Chandon
					holds a Royal Warrant as supplier of champagne to Queen Elizabeth II.
					In 2006, Moët et Chandon Brut Impérial issued an extremely limited
					bottling of its champagne named "Be Fabulous", a special release of its
					original bottle with decorative Swarovski crystals, marking the elegance
					of Moët et Chandon.
