		<p>Champagne borders Ile-de-France in the south-west. Its name comes from the Romans who called it Campania, meaning literally "Land of the Plains". The rolling prairies that give the region its name are located in the south between Reims/Epernay and Troyes. Closer to the border with Belgium, the landscape becomes more rugged and deeply forested.</p>
		<p>Champagne, lying south to the east of the Paris region, is one of the great historic provinces of France. As far back as the times of the Emperor Charlemagne, in the ninth century, Champagne was one of the great regions of Europe, a rich agricultural area that was famous for its fairs. Today, thanks to a type of sparkling wine to which the region has given its name, the word Champagne is known worldwide â€“ even if many of those who know the drink do not know exactly where it comes from.</p>

		<p>Champagne, that most delightful of sparkling wines, was not actually invented in the region. According to legend, it was monks who bought the method for making sparkling wine up from the Languedoc, in the south of France; but they soon discovered that the chalky soil and climatic conditions in the Champagne region produced a bright bubbly wine that was in many people's opinion better than the sparkling wines produced further south.</p>
		<p>The traditional French Northern cooking is based on the products of the soil - known as Cuisine du Terroir - and emphasizes the French Art de la Table. You could appreciate an andouillette de Troyes or the Rhetel recipe of boudin blanc, classics of the traditional family meals in the Champagne region. For the vegetables' lovers, the typical pot-au-feu-like La Joute is just as delightful.</p>
