                    French people are known for good fashion sense and good food. They
                    are courteous people, but also frank and usually to the point. French is

                    French. Indeed, your trip will be more enjoyable if you are able to relate
                    to French people. Also, it will be easier to understand the culture once

                    As for French manners, the handshake is commonly used in France
                    when people meet another for the first time, in both social and business
                    settings. Close friends greet each other by kissing each other on the
                    cheek (Ia bise). People typically greet one another with bonjour (good
                    morning), bonsoir (good afternoon) and au revoir (goodbye). Party
                    guests are expected to bring a gift, such as flowers or a bottle of wine.
